abstract = {The study of soil viruses, though not new, has languished relative to the study of marine viruses. This is particularly due to challenges associated with separating virions from harboring soils. Generally, three approaches to analyzing soil viruses have been employed: (1) Isolation, to characterize virus genotypes and phenotypes, the primary method used prior to the start of the 21st century. (2) Metagenomics, which has revealed a vast diversity of viruses while also allowing insights into viral community ecology, although with limitations due to DNA from cellular organisms obscuring viral DNA. (3) Viromics (targeted metagenomics of virus-like-particles), which has provided a more focused development of ‘virus-sequence-to-ecology' pipelines, a result of separation of presumptive virions from cellular organisms prior to DNA extraction. This separation permits greater sequencing emphasis on virus DNA and thereby more targeted molecular and ecological characterization of viruses. Employing viromics to characterize soil systems presents new challenges, however. Ones that only recently are being addressed. Here we provide a guide to implementing these three approaches to studying environmental viruses, highlighting benefits, difficulties, and potential contamination, all toward fostering greater focus on viruses in the study of soil ecology.},

abstract = {This study examines the deposition/release mechanisms involved in colloid retention under unfavorable conditions through theoretical analysis and laboratory column experiments. A Maxwell approach was utilized to estimate the coupled effects of primary- and secondary-minimum deposition. Theoretical analysis indicates that the secondary energy minimum plays a dominant role in colloid deposition even for nanosized particles (e.g., 20 nm) and primary-minimum deposition rarely happens for large colloids (e.g., 1000 nm) when diffusion is the dominant process. Polystyrene latex particles (30 and 1156 nm) and clean sand were used to conduct three-step column experiments at different solution ionic strengths, a constant pH of 10, and a flow rate of 0.0012 cm/s. Experimental results confirm that small colloids can also be deposited in secondary minima. Additional column experiments involving flow interruption further indicates that the colloids deposited in the secondary energy well can be spontaneously released to bulk solution when the secondary energy minimum is comparable to the average Brownian kinetic energy. Experimental collision efficiencies are in good agreement with Maxwell model predictions but different from the theoretical values calculated by the interfacial force boundary layer approximation. We propose a priori analytical approach to estimate collision efficiencies accounting for both primary- and secondary-minimum deposition and suggest that the reversibility of colloid (e.g., viruses and bacteria) deposition must be considered in transport models for accurate predictions of their travel time in the subsurface environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {More than 50% of the outbreaks of waterborne disease in the United States are due to the consumption of contaminated groundwater. An estimated 65% of the cases in these outbreaks are caused by enteric viruses. Little, however, is known about the persistence of viruses in groundwater. The purpose of this study was to determine whether measurable chemical and physical factors correlate with virus survival in groundwater. Groundwater samples were obtained from 11 sites throughout the United States. Water temperature was measured at the time of collection. Several physical and chemical characteristics, including pH, nitrates, turbidity, and hardness, were determined for each sample. Separate water samples were inoculated with each of three viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 1, and MS-2 coliphage) and incubated at the in situ groundwater temperature; selected samples were also incubated at other temperatures. Assays were performed at predetermined intervals over a 30-day period to determine the number of infective viruses remaining. Multiple regression analysis revealed that temperature was the only variable significantly correlated with the decay rates of all three viruses. No significant differences were found among the decay rates of the three viruses, an indication that MS-2 coliphage might be used as a model of animal virus survival in groundwater.},

Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy.

abstract = {As for the SARS coronavirus in the 2003 epidemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated in faeces and, in some cases, urine of infected people, as well as in wastewater. This paper proposes a critical review of the state of the art regarding studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and sewage sludge, the factors affecting its inactivation and the main proposed treatments, with the aim to provide useful information at operative level in order to better and safer manage wastewater and sewage sludge. Given the lack of literature on SARS-CoV-2, studies involving other HCoVs such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E have been also considered. In wastewater, the resistance of SARS-CoV has proven to be very limited, especially at temperatures above 20 °C, and the virus has been easily removed with the use of chlorine (> 0.5 mg L-1 for 30 min). For sewage sludge, based on in vitro experiments, it is suggested to increase the retention times before a possible reuse in agriculture only for precautionary purposes, since SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur in the sludge. SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater might track the epidemic trends: although being extremely promising, an effective and wide application of this approach requires a deeper knowledge of the amounts of viruses excreted through the faeces and the actual detectability of viral RNA in sewage. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No fundings received. ### Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

@article{Mi2020,
abstract = {Virus colloidal behavior is governed by the interaction of the viral surface and the surrounding environment. One method to characterize the virus surface charge is the isoelectric point (pI). Traditional determination of virus pI has focused on the bulk characterization of a viral solution. However, virus capsids are extremely heterogeneous, and a single-particle method may give more information on the range of surface charge observed across a population. One method to measure the virus pI is chemical force microscopy (CFM). CFM is a single-particle technique that measures the adhesion force of a functionalized atomic force microscope (AFM) probe and, in this case, a virus covalently bound to a surface. Non-enveloped porcine parvovirus (PPV) and enveloped bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were used to demonstrate the use of CFM for viral particles with different surface properties. We have validated the CFM to determine the pI of PPV to be 4.8-5.1, which has a known pI value of 5.0 in the literature, and to predict the unknown pI of BVDV to be 4.3-4.5. Bulk measurements, $\zeta$-potential, and aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) cross-partitioning methods were also used to validate the new CFM method for the virus pI. Most methods were in good agreement. CFM can detect the surface charge of viral capsids at a single-particle level and enable the comparison of surface charge between different types of viruses.},

abstract = {An understanding of the transport and survival of microbial pathogens (pathogens hereafter) in agricultural settings is needed to assess the risk of pathogen contamination to water and food resources, and to develop control strategies and treatment options. However, many knowledge gaps still remain in predicting the fate and transport of pathogens in runoff water, and then through the shallow vadose zone and groundwater. A number of transport pathways, processes, factors, and mathematical models often are needed to describe pathogen fate in agricultural settings. The level of complexity is dramatically enhanced by soil heterogeneity, as well as by temporal variability in temperature, water inputs, and pathogen sources. There is substantial variability in pathogen migration pathways, leading to changes in the dominant processes that control pathogen transport over different spatial and temporal scales. For example, intense rainfall events can generate runoff and preferential flow that can rapidly transport pathogens. Pathogens that survive for extended periods of time have a greatly enhanced probability of remaining viable when subjected to such rapid-transport events. Conversely, in dry seasons, pathogen transport depends more strongly on retention at diverse environmental surfaces controlled by a multitude of coupled physical, chemical, and microbiological factors. These interactions are incompletely characterized, leading to a lack of consensus on the proper mathematical framework to model pathogen transport even at the column scale. In addition, little is known about how to quantify transport and survival parameters at the scale of agricultural fields or watersheds. This review summarizes current conceptual and quantitative models for pathogen transport and fate in agricultural settings over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The authors also discuss the benefits that can be realized by improved modeling, and potential treatments to mitigate the risk of waterborne disease transmission.},

Efforts have been made to find enveloped virus surrogates due to challenges investigating viruses that require biosafety-level 3 or 4 handling. In this study, the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6 was evaluated as a surrogate for enveloped waterborne viruses. The persistence of Phi6 was tested in aqueous conditions chosen based on previously published viral persistence studies. Our results demonstrated that the predicted T90 (time for 90% inactivation) of Phi6 under the 12 evaluated conditions varied from 24 min to 117 days depending on temperature, biological activity, and aqueous media composition. Phi6 persistence was then compared with persistence values from other enveloped viruses reported in the literature. The apparent suitability of Phi6 as an enveloped virus surrogate was dependent on the temperature and composition of the media tested. Of evaluated viruses, 33%, including all conditions considered, had T90 values greater than the 95% confidence interval for Phi6. Ultimately, these results highlight the variability of enveloped virus persistence in the environment and the value of working with the virus of interest for environmental persistence studies.},

Current virus transport models do not consider the implications of the reversibility of virus attachment to minerals. To explore the reversibility of virus attachment to mineral surfaces, we attached PRD1, a bacteriophage considered to be a good model of enteric viruses, to quartz and ferric oxyhydroxide-coated quartz surfaces over a range of pH values in equilibrium 'static columns'. Following attachment, we detached the viruses by replacing the pore solution with solutions of equal and higher pH. The extent of virus attachment followed an attachment 'edge' that occurred at a pH value about 2.5-3.5 pH units above the pH(IEP) of the mineral surfaces. Viruses attached below this edge were irreversibly attached until the pH of the detachment solution exceeded the pH value of the attachment edge. Viruses attached above this edge were reversibly attached. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DEVO) potential energy calculations showed that the attachment edge occurred at the pH at which the potential energy of the primary minimum was near zero, implying that the position of the primary minimum (attractive or repulsive) controlled the equilibrium distribution of the viruses. The results suggest that the reversibility of virus attachment must be considered in virus transport models for accurate predictions of virus travel time.},

The relative contributions of different interaction forces to adsorption and their dependence on the physicochemical properties of the viruses remain, however, only poorly understood. Herein, we systematically studied the adsorption of four bacteriophages (MS2, fr, GA, and Q$\beta$) to five model surfaces with varying surface chemistries and to three dissolved organic matter adlayers, as a function of solution pH and ionic strength, using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. The viruses were selected to have similar sizes and shapes but different surface charges, polarities, and topographies, as identified by modeling the distributions of amino acids in the virus capsids. Virus-sorbent interactions were governed by long-ranged electrostatics and favorable contributions from the hydrophobic effect, and shorter-ranged van der Waals interactions were of secondary importance. Steric effects depended on the topographic irregularities on both the virus and sorbent surfaces. Differences in the adsorption characteristics of the tested viruses were successfully linked to differences in their capsid surface properties. Besides identifying the major interaction forces, this work highlights the potential of computable virus surface charge and polarity descriptors to predict virus adsorption to solid-water interfaces.},

The model involves solution of the advection-dispersion equation, which additionally considers virus inactivation in the solution, as well as virus removal at the solid matrix surface due to attachment (deposition), release, and inactivation. Two surface inactivation models for the fate of attached inactive viruses and their subsequent role on virus attachment and release were considered. Geochemical heterogeneity, portrayed as patches of positively charged metal oxyhydroxide coatings on collector grain surfaces, and physical heterogeneity, portrayed as spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, were incorporated in the model. Both layered and randomly (log-normally) distributed physical and geochemical heterogeneities were considered. The upstream weighted multiple cell balance method was employed to numerically solve the governing equations of groundwater flow and virus transport. Model predictions show that the presence of subsurface layered geochemical and physical heterogeneity results in preferential flow paths and thus significantly affect virus mobility. Random distributions of physical and geochemical heterogeneity have also notable influence on the virus transport behavior. While the solution inactivation rate was found to significantly influence the virus transport behavior, surface inactivation under realistic field conditions has probably a negligible influence on the overall virus transport. It was further demonstrated that large virus release rates result in extended periods of virus breakthrough over significant distances downstream from the injection sites. This behavior suggests that simpler models that account for virus adsorption through a retardation factor may yield a misleading assessment of virus transport in "hydrogeologically sensitive" subsurface environments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and its potential environmental transmission indicates the need for more information on the survival of coronavirus in water and wastewater. The survival of representative coronaviruses, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E was determined in filtered and unfiltered tap water (4 and 23°C) and wastewater (23°C). This was compared to poliovirus 1 under the same test conditions. Inactivation of coronaviruses in the test water was highly dependent on temperature, level of organic matter, and presence of antagonistic bacteria. The time required for the virus titer to decrease 99.9% (T99.9) shows that in tap water, coronaviruses are inactivated faster in water at 23°C (10 days) than in water at 4°C (>100 days). Coronaviruses die off rapidly in wastewater, with T99.9 values of between 2 and 4 days. Poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all test waters, except the 4°C tap water.},

abstract = {A new equation for predicting the single-collector contact efficiency ($\eta$0) in physicochemical particle filtration in saturated porous media is presented. The correlation equation is developed assuming that the overall single-collector efficiency can be calculated as the sum of the contributions of the individual transport mechanisms-Brownian diffusion, interception, and gravitational sedimentation. To obtain the correlation equation, the dimensionless parameters governing particle deposition are regressed against the theoretical value of the single-collector efficiency over a broad range of parameter values. Rigorous numerical solution of the convective-diffusion equation with hydrodynamic interactions and universal van der Waals attractive forces fully incorporated provided the theoretical single-collector efficiencies. The resulting equation overcomes the limitations of current approaches and shows remarkable agreement with exact theoretical predictions of the single-collector efficiency over a wide range of conditions commonly encountered in natural and engineered aquatic systems. Furthermore, experimental data are in much closer agreement with predictions based on the new correlation equation compared to other available expressions.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. This scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on CoV in water environments. A literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web Science Core Collection. This comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records, but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review. In detail, the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) CoV persistence/survival in waters; 2) CoV occurrence in water environments; 3) methods for recovery of CoV from waters. The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C–25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments. The evidence-based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain (i.e., water and sanitation safety planning) to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water.},

abstract = {Microbiological contaminants (e.g., bacteria, protozoa, and viruses)pose one of the greatest risks in water resources. About 70%of the waterborne microbial illness outbreaks in the United States has been associated with groundwater. Although viruses are not the only pathogens known to contaminate groundwater, they are much smaller in size than bacteria or protozoan cysts and are not filtered out to the same extent in the porous soil matrix. Knowledge of the factors that influence the fate and transport of viruses in soil and aquifers is critical to making accurate determinations of groundwater vulnerability and to developing regulations that are protective of public health. In this paper,we review the current state of knowledge on fate and transport of viruses in porous media which include (i)mechanisms and modeling of virus sorption, (ii)virus survival and factors affecting virus inactivation in the natural environment, and (iii)mechanisms of virus transport in porous media and available modeling approaches. Because viruses are surrounded by a protein capsid and are expected to behave similarly to proteins,an overview on the mechanisms of protein sorption and denaturation is also provided. Factors such as solution chemistry, virus properties, soil properties,temperature,association with solid particles, and water content have been found to influence virus sorption, survival, and transport in porous media. A review of protein literature provides some insights as to what mechanism might be involved in virus sorption that have so far not been studied. Some needs for future research are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2002.},

abstract = {Many of the devastating pandemics and outbreaks of the 20th and 21st centuries have involved enveloped viruses, including influenza, HIV, SARS, MERS, and Ebola. However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and {\o}6) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and {\o}6 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (±SD) of 25.1% (±3.6%) and 18.2% (±9.5%) for the enveloped MHV and {\o}6, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6% (±16.7%) and 85.5% (±24.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7% of MHV and 2% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.},

abstract = {A more detailed characterization of particulate organic matter in wastewater streams is needed to improve solid-liquid separation and biological processes for wastewater treatment. The objective of this paper was to evaluate particle size distributions and the associated chemical composition for municipal, industrial, and agricultural waste streams. Most of the organic matter in these wastewaters was larger than a molecular weight of 10 3 amu and therefore would require extracellular hydrolysis before any bacterial metabolism. Particle size distributions were significantly different for the studied waste streams. In municipal wastewater, the organic matter was evenly distributed in all eight size fractions ranging from 10 3 amu up to 63 $\mu$m. The industrial and agricultural wastewaters, however, contained mainly soluble organic matter (<103 amu) and larger particles (>1.2 $\mu$m for the industrial and >10 $\mu$m for the agricultural waste) leaving a gap in the size range of large macromolecules and colloids. The relative protein and carbohydrate concentrations varied for the different size fractions compared to the measured chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the corresponding size fraction. Thus, the design of the solid-liquid separation at a treatment plant could be used to purposefully modify the overall chemical composition of the organic matter before further biological treatment. Particle size distributions will influence design and operation of biological nutrient removal processes such as denitrification or biological phosphorus removal that may be carbon limited if a large fraction of the organic matter is composed of large particles with slow hydrolysis rates. Measured particle size distributions for the different waste streams in this study (municipal, industrial, agricultural) were significantly different requiring specific approaches for treatment plant design. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus ($\beta$CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators.},

Possible inactivation, downstream, and formulation conditions are given including suitable buffers and some first ideas for quality-control methods. This information supports vaccine development and discussion with competent authorities during vaccine approval and is certainly related to drug-targeting strategies and hygienics. Several instructive tables are given, including the pI and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins in comparison. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in many regards, so information can often be derived. Both are unusually stable, but sensitive at their lipophilic membranes. However, since seemingly small differences can have strong effects, for example, on immunologically relevant epitope settings, unevaluated knowledge transfer from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 cannot be advised. Published knowledge regarding downstream processes, formulations and quality assuring methods is, as yet, limited.

abstract = {This chapter highlights how the current understanding of the mechanisms and factors influencing virus adsorption can be used to interpret and control virus behavior in the environment. An understanding of factors controlling the interaction has already led to new and improved methods for the concentration of viruses from water, and their isolation from the environment. It is evident that not all viruses behave alike toward a solid under identical conditions. Under most natural conditions viruses with a low isoelectric point appear to be more poorly adsorbed to most solid surfaces. This must be taken into consideration when evaluating concentration or treatment systems which involve adsorption. This phenomenon is also important in determining the transport of viruses in the environment. Certain enteric viruses appear to adsorb less readily to soils and aquatic sediments than others. Thus their potential transport to groundwater may be greater and they may be less likely to settle in surface waters. To take into consideration these differences in virus behavior, it is perhaps best to use viruses with widely varying isoelectric points or marked differences in hydrophobicity to evaluate the extremes in virus interaction with a given surface which could occur. {\textcopyright} 1984, Elsevier Inc.

To characterize and understand infectious risks associated with land application, and to describe the diversity of viruses in human populations, shotgun viral metagenomics was applied to 10 sewage sludge samples from 5 wastewater treatment plants throughout the continental U.S, each serving between 100 000 and 1 000 000 people. Nearly 330 million DNA sequences were produced and assembled, and annotation resulted in identifying 43 (26 DNA, 17 RNA) different types of human viruses in sewage sludge. Novel insights include the high abundance of newly emerging viruses (e.g., Coronavirus HKU1, Klassevirus, and Cosavirus) the strong representation of respiratory viruses, and the relatively minor abundance and occurrence of Enteroviruses. Viral metagenome sequence annotations were reproducible and independent PCR-based identification of selected viruses suggests that viral metagenomes were a conservative estimate of the true viral occurrence and diversity. These results represent the most complete description of human virus diversity in any wastewater sample to date, provide engineers and environmental scientists with critical information on important viral agents and routes of infection from exposure to wastewater and sewage sludge, and represent a significant leap forward in understanding the pathogen content of class B biosolids. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) demonstrates potential for COVID-19 community transmission monitoring; however, data on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater are needed to interpret WBE results. The decay rates of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and a potential surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), were investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in untreated wastewater, autoclaved wastewater, and dechlorinated tap water stored at 4, 15, 25, and 37 °C. Temperature, followed by matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T90 (time required for 1-log10 reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T90 for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37 °C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 days in untreated wastewater, 5.58–43.1 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 10.9 to 43.9 days in tap water. There was no statistically significant difference between RNA decay of SARS-CoV-2 and MHV; thus, MHV is suggested as a suitable persistence surrogate. Decay rate constants for all temperatures were comparable across all matrices for both viral RNAs, except in untreated wastewater for SARS-CoV-2, which showed less sensitivity to elevated temperatures. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for WBE application.},
